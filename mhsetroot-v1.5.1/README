Wallpaper setting utility with cool options

A script is added to set your wallpaper at different random setting.

SetWallPaperScript.sh 

Just rename it to what ever you want, make the changes needed in the
script where I put comments to add your script name and path to your
wallpaper then put it in your home directory and run it from your
command line. Donâ€™t forget to change the setting in the script for it to
work properly. 

known bugs in the script: sometimes Random sets a bad color value by not
giving it the needed 6 number letters combination if you wish you can 
add a function to ensure that it is always 6 but it does not effect the
setting of the wallpaper, or mhsetroot. 

Other then that it is a cool script to put up random background colors
and images on your desktop, randomly. :)

WALLPAPERS=/path/to/your/wallpaper

chmod +x <name of the script>

to change the time setting from the command line just
type on the command line ./script name <time  in minutes  you want the wallpaper 
to change then >/dev/null 2>/dev/null & to set it in the back ground

<to Install mhsetroot>

 ./configue
 
  make
  
  sudo make install
